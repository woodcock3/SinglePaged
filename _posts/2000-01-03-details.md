## "Him we proclaim, warning everyone and teaching everyone with all wisdom"

We're a bible believing, bible practicing and bible proclaiming church here in Beeston and Leeds. Our congregation is full of people from all walks of life, all stages of life and many different countries. We want to see people know God through Jesus Christ and begin their lifelong journey of becoming more like Him. 

Colossians 1:28 sums up our aim, "Him we proclaim, warning everyone and teaching everyone with all wisdom, that we may present everyone mature in Christ." As Jesus said, "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations." 

Realising our need for God and His Spirit to be at work among us, we strive for an atmosphere of prayer in everything we do.

We're a part of the [Fellowship of Independent Evangelical Churches (FIEC)](https://fiec.org.uk) as well as a member of the [Yorkshire Gospel Partnership (YGP)](http://ygp.org.uk).
